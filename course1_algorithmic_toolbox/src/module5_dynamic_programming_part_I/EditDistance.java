/**
 * Edit Distance Problem
 * Compute the edit distance between two strings.
 * <p>
 * Input: Two strings.
 * Output: The minimum number of single-symbol insertions, deletions,
 * and substitutions to transform one string into the other one.
 * <p>
 * The Edit Distance Problem has many applications in computational
 * biology, natural language processing, spell checking, and many other areas.
 * For example, biologists often compute edit distances when they search for
 * disease-causing mutations.
 * The edit distance between two strings is defined as the minimum number of single-symbol insertions,
 * deletions, and substitutions to transform one string into the other one.
 * <p>
 * Input format. Two strings consisting of lower case Latin letters, each on a separate line.
 * Output format. The edit distance between them.
 * <p>
 * Constraints. The length of both strings is at least 1 and at most 100.
 * <p>
 * Sample 1.
 * Input:
 * short
 * ports
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * 3
 * Explanation
 * The second string can be obtained from the first one by deleting s, substituting h for p, and inserting s.

class EditDistance {
    /**
     * Computes the edit distance between two strings using the Levenshtein algorithm.
     * The edit distance is defined as the minimum number of single-character insertions,
     * deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into the other.
     * Sometimes, itâ€™s also called the Wagner-Fischer algorithm, named after the researchers
     * who formalized and optimized it for dynamic programming in 1974.
     * <p>
     * This method uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the edit distance
     * by constructing a 2D table (dp) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the edit distance
     * between the substrings s[0..i-1] and t[0..j-1].
     * <p>
     * The Levenshtein algorithm iterates over each character pair in the two strings
     * to build up the solution incrementally, ensuring that each sub-problem is solved
     * optimally. This approach minimizes redundant calculations and achieves a time
     * complexity of O(n * m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings.
     * <p>
     * Usage:
     * - Useful in applications like computational biology (e.g., DNA sequence alignment),
     * natural language processing (e.g., spell checking and similarity scoring), and
     * version control (e.g., tracking changes between file versions).
     *
     * @param s The first input string.
     * @param t The second input string.
     * @return The edit distance between the input strings.
     * <p>
     * Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n and m are the lengths of the two strings.
     * Space Complexity: O(n * m) due to the DP table.
